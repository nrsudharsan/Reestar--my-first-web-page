This project is a simple web page created as part of my learning journey in web development. It is built using HTML and CSS, focusing on the fundamentals of web design and layout. The page includes basic elements like text, images, links, and styling to create a visually appealing and functional design.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured and organized HTML and CSS code for easy understanding and modification.
- **Basic Styling**: Uses CSS for styling elements like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and more.

## Technologies Used:

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Future Improvements:

- Expanding layout with more advanced CSS techniques.
- Implementing a navigation menu or footer.
